### What's the most common license id

```{r}
top_lic <- data %>% 
  group_by(license_id) %>% 
  summarise(num = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num))


head(top_lic,10)
```

### What's the most popular project? 
#### ranked by how many copies are in the dataset for each open source project id

```{r}


(top_uuid <- data %>% 
  group_by(d_r_uuid) %>% 
  summarise(num = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num)) %>% 
  head(10))

```

### What's the most popular version for each of the top projects?

```{r}

data %>% 
  filter(d_r_uuid %in% top_uuid$d_r_uuid) %>% 
  group_by(d_r_uuid,version) %>% 
  summarise(num = n()) %>% 
  View()
  
```

## Insight: Each d_r_uuid (open source project id) is associated with a unique version of a project. In other words, different versions of the same project will have different open source project ids.
